### Patient is triaged where there is no indication that immediate critical care is needed

#### Scenario

After being [checked in](scenario-register-patient-in-reception.html), [Dylan Jones](Patient-DylanJones.html) waits in the waiting room to see the triage nurse.  A triage nurse, [Andrei Herakles](Practitioner-Practitioner-TriageNurse.html) retrieves the next [patient](Patient-DylanJones.html) from the local clinical system and calls [Dylan](Patient-DylanJones.html) into the consultation room.

[Andrei](Practitioner-Practitioner-TriageNurse.html) uses the [MTS](https://www.triagenet.net/)(Manchester Triage System) and determines [Dylan's](Patient-DylanJones.html) [EWS](todo.html)(Early Warning Score).  Some of the vital signs indicate that [Dylan](Patient-DylanJones.html) may have an infection, therefore [Andrei](Practitioner-Practitioner-TriageNurse.html) orders a [CBC](todo.html)(Complete Blood Count) panel of blood tests.

<!-- not doing an ECG here, another scenario that made sense for an ECG could be done -->
The bloods are taken by a healthcare assistant [Derby Lovell](Practitioner-Practitioner-HealthcareAssistant.html) and the orders are also entered into the national clinical portal.  Patient identifier stickers are printed using the national demographics system and attached to the [blood tests](todo.html).  The bloods are then sent through the internal sample transport system.  [Dylan](Patient-DylanJones.html) is then directed to return to the waiting room.
