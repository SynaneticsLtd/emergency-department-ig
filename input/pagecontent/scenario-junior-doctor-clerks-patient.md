### Junior doctor clerks the patient

The junior doctor [Isabella Emmaline](todo.html) begins the clerking of the [patient](Patient-DylanJones.html).  [Isabella](todo.html) reviews [all information available](todo - maybe a searchset) about the [patient](Patient-DylanJones.html).  They take [notes](todo.html) detailing their current understanding of the patient.

[Isabella](todo.html) then [locates](todo.html) the [patient](Patient-DylanJones.html) to carry out their [assessment](todo.html).  They confirm the [medical history](todo - maybe a searchset) with the [patient](Patient-DylanJones.html) and take [further notes](todo.html) about the patients condition.

As a result the [assessment], [Isabella](todo.html) decides to order further [blood tests](todo.html) **(TODO - some details on something that medically fits in this context?)**.  [Isabella](todo.html) also decides to order a [prescription](todo.html) **(TODO - some details on something that medically fits in this context?)** for the [patient](Patient-DylanJones.html).  The [patient](Patient-DylanJones.html) then returns to the waiting room.
